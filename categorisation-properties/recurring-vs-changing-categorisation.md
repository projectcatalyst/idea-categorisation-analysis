# Recurring vs Changing Categorisation

### Funding categorisation: recurring vs changing

Funding categorisation can be recurring when it is well defined and repeatedly used in each funding round. Alternatively categorisation can also be always changing where new categorisation approaches are defined and used each round.



**Recurring categorisation**

Recurring categorisation means looking to make sensible groupings of similar focus areas that are well defined. These categorisations can be used on a recurring basis in every funding round. Recurring categorisation would still be changed over time, but the aim would be only to change the categorisations when necessary.

**Changing categorisation**

Changing categorisation looks to introduce a new groupings of focus areas for funding each funding round. This is not to say similar categorisation couldn't be used again but instead that categorisation would compete again to be used and can be redefined or updated as part of the funding process.



### Factors to consider

* **Budget weighting complexity** - What complexity is there for deciding the budget weightings for each categorisation approach? How much effort and how long will it take to get a well informed outcome?
* **Categorisation justification** - How complex is it to provide evidence and data to justify all categorisation selected for a given funding round? How much effort and governance is required?
* **Directing funding** - How effective is the categorisation for directing funding to certain areas that need more funding support?
* **Governance effort** - How much effort is needed to govern the selection and usage of the categorisations?
* **Stakeholder effort** - How much effort is required to maintain this type of categorisation for the different stakeholders involved in the funding process?



### Recurring funding categorisation

**Advantages**

* **Less budget weighting complexity** - Using recurring categorisations in each funding round will mean having more data and insights on how the categorisations were used in previous rounds. This data will make it easier for the community to make better informed decisions on how to better distribute funding between the categorisations in the following rounds.
* **Low categorisation justification** - All effort for categorisation is done upfront and then changed when necessary. This means stakeholders involved in managing the categorisation don't need to justify it each funding round and this effort is done upfront.
* **Low governance effort** - Repeatedly using the same categorisations means you don't need the community to review and vote on which categorisations to use. Instead the focus stays on only the budget weightings to use for the ones that are being used.
* **Low stakeholder effort** - Recurring categorisations means the proposers and voters get the benefit of becoming more familiar with the categorisations over time and can fully understand the types of proposals that should be placed into each categorisation. This simplicity reduces ongoing effort for all stakeholders involved to understand the categorisation part of the funding process. This in turn speeds up overall interactions with the funding process.&#x20;

**Issues**

* **Harder to direct funding** - Using recurring categorisations could mean they are less effective at directing funding from one area to another at the categorisation level. This is not a large issue as the voters still get to decide where they want to allocate funding using their vote and there are many [approaches for directing funding](../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that can be used.



### Changing funding categorisation

**Advantages**

* **Easier to direct funding** - Changing categorisation each funding round means the community could make groupings that focus on a different areas that are of higher importance in the short term. This however comes at a cost of putting a mandate on where funding must be allocated and increases the risk of issues that occur in adverse situations where few or low quality proposals are presented for the categorisations that are available.

**Issues**

* **Increased categorisation justification** - If categorisations change every funding round the community will need to review and justify that the categorisation is suitable and should be used in the funding process.
* **Increased budget weighting complexity** - New categorisation approaches would need to find relevant insights, data and community feedback to justify the budget weighting of the categorisation. If it is a new type of categorisation it would be more difficult to be well informed in most cases on what budget weighting should be applied.
* **High governance effort** - Every funding round those involved in governing the categorisation would need to review all the categories being suggested and ensure the right information is covered to make well informed categorisation decisions.
* **High stakeholder effort** - Voters and proposers would need to get familiar with new categorisations every funding round. This increases the time required to fully understand what categorisations exist and the types of proposal that should be included.



### Summary

* **Many ways to direct funding** - Having changing funding categorisation can be one way that the community could use to direct funding. The problem with this is it means predicting ahead of time what ideas and innovation will be submitted for those categorisations of focus areas. There is never a guarantee that proposals will be submitted or the ones submitted are of sufficient quality. Alternatively there are other approaches to [direct funding](../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that do not need to impact funding categorisation.&#x20;
* **Changing categorisation introduces high effort and complexity** - Constantly changing categorisations increases effort required for all the stakeholders involved in the funding process in terms of total time required and governance effort. There are numerous ways to [direct funding outside of changing the categorisation](../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md). With no other significant benefits for changing categorisation on a regular basis there does not appear to be many reasons to use this as an approach for funding categorisation.
