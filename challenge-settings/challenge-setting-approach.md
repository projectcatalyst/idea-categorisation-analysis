# Challenge Setting Approach

### **Process**

The current process for allocating funding is the use of challenges that are set by the community. The process goes as follows:

1. Community members creates proposals outlining a challenge setting. Included is why it is important, what success looks like, key metrics to measure and a challenge brief outlining the challenge topic, directions proposers could take and the type of problems they are looking to solve. Challenge setting proposals will also include a budget requested which will come from the total available funding in the next funding round.
2. Community provides feedback to the challenge settings for two weeks after initial submissions.
3. Community members join as co-proposers for challenges they want to help support.
4. Challenge setting proposals are finalised.
5. Community upvotes, downvotes or abstains from voting for each of the challenge setting proposals in the governance phase of a funding round. Vote weighting is currently plutocratic where the total ADA from the registered wallets is used to determine the voting outcome.
6. The community challenges with the most upvotes are selected for the next fund to become challenges. The challenges must fit into the total budget allocated as each one is selected based on highest vote preference.
7. Challenge teams support explanation and operation of the challenge during the funding round

### **Issues**

**Low barrier of entry for malicious actors**

Anyone can create challenge setting proposals meaning there is a very low barrier for anyone to try and harm the process. Malicious actors could for example spam the system, try to persuade the community to go down a less impactful path or add duplicate challenge proposals with slightly different topics or budgets to increase overall complexity.



**Budget weighting complexity**

The budget weighting for challenge settings is self determined by the proposal. The proposer does not need to follow any process, provide data or use any democratic process to most effectively inform a sensible budget for that given challenge setting.



**Complexity justifying specific challenge settings**

The general guidelines for challenge setting proposals are to not be too broad but also not too specific. As the proposer is free to make any challenge the risk still exists that the challenge could be overly specific. For instance a challenge setting called [Connecting Japan/日本 Community](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26238/about) focusses on the country of Japan. The population for Japan is around 125 million. The total worldwide population is 7.9 billion. The challenge targets around 1.58% of the global population which makes the challenge very specific. This adds complexity as more data, reasoning and evidence is needed to provide confidence on whether this specificity of focus is an effective way to direct funding over other options. The example above is not trying to suggest what specific challenge is and is not effective for funding allocation. Instead the only important thing to highlight is how specific challenges increase the complexity of justifying and governing the decisions of where to allocate funding. This complexity is a time and resource cost that impacts all stakeholders in the ecosystem.



**Limited challenge team knowledge or ecosystem understanding**

Currently anyone can create a challenge setting proposal. This increases the risk that proposal teams are not fully informed on the ecosystem and the most pressing requirements to create well informed challenge setting proposals.



**No comprehensive data and supporting evidence**

Currently proposers do not need to provide any data or supporting evidence as to why the challenge setting is needed at this precise time in the ecosystem over other areas. This increases the risks that the challenge setting may not be well justified or be a higher priority for the ecosystem over other areas.

**Requires high stakeholder involvement**

Creating and selecting challenges for future rounds is time consuming and complex for every engaged community member in the Catalyst ecosystem. Each community member needs to more deeply understand the needs of the ecosystem, the challenge setting proposals that have been created and to rank which ones are most suitable and sensible.

****

**Duplicate challenge settings**

There is no process currently to prevent duplicate challenge settings which may have little differences with other challenge setting proposals. This creates the risk of having similar challenges funded that would mean a far greater amount of funding being directed to only a few areas of the ecosystem. This can cause a stagnation in innovation and community efforts for areas that need funding support.



**Challenges influenced by self interest**

Currently anyone can create a challenge setting proposal which opens up the system for people, teams or companies creating challenge settings to help serve their self interest instead of the overall needs of the community. If this incentive exists it should be assumed that it will be abused without the right processes and protections in place to prevent it.
