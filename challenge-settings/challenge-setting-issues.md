# Challenge Setting Issues

**Low barrier of entry for malicious actors**

Anyone can create challenge setting proposals meaning there is a very low barrier for anyone to try and harm the process. Malicious actors could for example spam the system, try to persuade the community to go down a less impactful path or add duplicate challenge proposals with slightly different topics or budgets to increase overall complexity.



**Unilateral budget weighting decisions and increased complexity**

The budget weighting for challenge settings is self determined by the proposal. The proposer does not need to follow any process, provide data or use any democratic process to most effectively inform a sensible budget for that given challenge setting. The budget weighting decisions are unilateral and not democratic. An increasing number of specific funding categorisations make budget weighting more complex.



**Complexity justifying specific challenge settings**

The general guidelines for challenge setting proposals are to not be too broad but also not too specific. As the proposer is free to make any challenge the risk still exists that the challenge could be overly specific. For instance a challenge setting called [Connecting Japan/日本 Community](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26238/about) focusses on the country of Japan. The population for Japan is around 125 million. The total worldwide population is 7.9 billion. The challenge targets around 1.58% of the global population which makes the challenge very specific. This adds complexity as more data, reasoning and evidence is needed to provide confidence on whether this specificity of focus is an effective way to direct funding over other options. The example above is not trying to suggest what specific challenge is and is not effective for funding allocation. Instead the only important thing to highlight is how specific challenges increase the complexity of justifying and governance over the decisions of where to allocate funding. This complexity is a time and resource cost that impacts all stakeholders in the ecosystem.



**Limited challenge team knowledge or ecosystem understanding**

Currently anyone can create a challenge setting proposal. This increases the risk that proposal teams are not fully informed on the ecosystem and the most pressing requirements to create well informed challenge setting proposals.



**No comprehensive data and supporting evidence**

Currently proposers do not need to provide any data or supporting evidence as to why the challenge setting is needed at this precise time in the ecosystem over other areas. This increases the risks that the challenge setting may not be well justified or be a higher priority for the ecosystem over other areas.

**Time consuming for multiple stakeholders**

Creating and selecting challenges for future rounds is time consuming and complex for every engaged community member in the Catalyst ecosystem. Each community member needs to more thoroughly understand the needs of the ecosystem, the challenge setting proposals that have been created and to rank which ones are most suitable and sensible. Challenge settings impact the time required from proposal assessors, voters and proposers.

****

**Duplicate challenge settings**

There is no process currently to prevent duplicate challenge settings which may have little differences with other challenge setting proposals. This creates the risk of having similar challenges funded that would mean a far greater amount of funding being directed to only a few areas of the ecosystem. This can cause a stagnation in innovation and community efforts for areas that need funding support.



**Overlapping categorisations**

With constantly changing categorisations set by the community it becomes easy for categorisations to have similarities and overlap with other selected categorisations. This increases confusion and complexity amongst voters and proposers, makes it more difficult to direct funding and also increases complexity to analyse the impact and usage of funding categorisation.

****

**No funding access for certain ideas and innovation**

Challenge settings compete with one another every funding round. This makes it easier for focus areas with different ideas and innovation to be excluded from the funding process depending on the voting outcome. This means potentially impactful proposals cannot request funding which leads to stifling innovation and progress in the ecosystem for certain focus areas. An exclusionary funding categorisation environment can easily result in excluding minorities of the ecosystem. Minorities that have less voting power will struggle to promote and get as much success in getting categorisations selected by the community that are relevant to their own goals and objectives.&#x20;



**Struggles to handle common situations**

Challenge settings invite any form of categorisation. Specific categorisations easily lead to situations that lead to bad outcome. A given goal, objective or specific focus area can have situations where few proposals turn up or that ones that do are low quality. There are also situations where something in the community becomes higher priority or an existing goal or objective becomes lower priority. Specific categorisations caused by the challenge setting process aren't flexible to a dynamically changing environment and requirements.



**Challenges influenced by self interest**

Currently anyone can create a challenge setting proposal which opens up the system for people, teams or companies creating challenge settings to help serve their self interest instead of the overall needs of the community. If this incentive exists it should be assumed that it will be abused without the right processes and protections in place to prevent it.

****

**Difficult to scale**

Challenge settings become more complex are they scale as to have community set funding categorisations there would be an increasing amount of assessments, challenge proposers and time needed for voters to assess the challenges. When coupled with an increasing amount of proposals over time the funding process becomes overly complex for the average voter to participate. Increasing complexity for the voter will lead to centralisation in events where they can delegate their vote to someone else due to the process being too time consuming of complex for them to participate.



**Weak competition between proposers**

Using an increasing number of specific funding categorisations leads to reducing the competition between proposers on more specific focus areas. This reduction in competition can lead to easier access to funding for weaker proposals due to a lack of optionality for voters to choose from.
