# FAQs

**Who has control over maintaining categories?**&#x20;

Catalyst contributors once initiated will be who maintains and improves the Catalyst funding categories. No existing group or individual will have control over this documentation or the categorisation. Catalyst contributors would be expected to host and manage this GitBook themselves.

**Why is there only a small participation in the budget weighting vote?**

The initial vote included 19 community members across a live and asynchronous vote to do the budget weighting for the seven different categories for fund 8. This was a first attempt at gathering as many community members as possible in a short time frame to democratically vote on the budget weightings for each of the categories.

Currently existing challenge teams will self determine their own budget. This is an issue as it means a small challenge team has a high influence over the funding allocated to certain areas in the ecosystem. The initial community vote was one of the most open and democratically conducted vote so far for Catalyst to determine budget weightings for funding categorisation.

The intention for this in the future will be for Catalyst contributors to host a more wide reaching vote to include more of the community in future iterations.

**Why are there so many proposal types in each category?**

Using broad categories that include a wide number of ideas was the intention behind the categories. Specific funding categorisation adds significant complexity in governance and effort required by the community which we outline when exploring [broad vs specific categorisation](../../categorisation-approaches/broad-vs-specific-categorisations.md).



**Who will be managing Catalyst and Cardano contributors?**

No individual or group manages the Catalyst or Cardano contributors. Once elected through the Catalyst governance process they will be paid to work as a collective group to support either the Catalyst or Cardano ecosystems. Contributors are autonomous in how they organise themselves and make decisions.&#x20;



**How will category teams be effective when there are bigger budgets and more proposal types?**

There will be only so much that a category team can do to support a wider range of ideas and innovation with an increased amount of proposals. To resolve this concern we've highlighted the impact of having [less specialised challenge teams](../concerns-and-solutions/less-specialised-challenge-teams.md) which describe how category teams can be used along with experts or topic focussed community groups to support more specialised issues around a certain topic area.



**Why cant we use both broad categories and challenges?**

Using broad categories and challenge settings means not removing the complexities on governance and budget weighting and the increased stakeholder effort to manage the funding categorisation. We documented the impact of [using categories and challenges](using-categories-and-challenges.md).
