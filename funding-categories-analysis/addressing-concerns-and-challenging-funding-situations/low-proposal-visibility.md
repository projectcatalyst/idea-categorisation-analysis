# Low Proposal Visibility

### Problem

Funding categorisations which invite a larger number of proposals can decrease the visibility of proposals and make it hard for voters to go through different types of proposals in one categorisation.



### **Relevance to funding categorisation**

Funding categorisations impact proposal visibility due to what different types of proposals can be submitted and where they can be submitted into the categorisations. The following categorisation approaches could impact proposal visibility:

* **Broad vs specific categorisations** - Using broad categorisations will increase the number of proposals in each categorisation which will reduce visibility. Specific categorisations leads to less proposals in each categorisation meaning proposal visibility is less of an issue.
* **Inclusive vs exclusive categorisations** - Using inclusive funding categorisation will increase the number of proposals which an be submitted. Exclusive funding categorisation would reduce the of proposals that can be submitted by restricting which focus areas are allowed.
* **Unique vs overlapping categorisations** - Unique categorisations help to increase proposal visibility as proposals of a similar focus will be placed into a single categorisation meaning voters don't need to find similar proposals in other categorisations. Overlapping categorisations decrease proposal visibility as it increases the number of categorisation that a single proposal could be submitted.



### Potential Solutions



**Improvements for viewing proposals**

Decreasing proposal visibility by having multiple types of proposals within a single category does not need to be a problem solved by funding categorisation. How proposals are viewed in the voting app is determined by the view layer. The voting app can integrate more ways for how to view proposals and make it easier to traverse a large number of proposals. This can include integrating tagging or curated lists in the view layer. This would make it easier for the community to compare proposals. Proposal tagging will be one important integration into the proposal submission and voting process so that the community is able to filter proposals by certain types such as DeFi, wallets or gaming.&#x20;



**Integrate any of the many approaches that help with directing funding**

The numerous [approaches to direct funding](../../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that help with directing funding are also relevant for improving proposal visibility. Curated lists as one example is one way to create digestible lists of proposals in topic and theme based groupings. Curated lists could be created by the community, content creators or even [Catalyst contributors](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/j1kv4hiNJHn5g0WEyrK5/). Community priority voting would also help with proposal visibility if the community is able to easily sort or filter proposals based on which priorities they are addressing.
