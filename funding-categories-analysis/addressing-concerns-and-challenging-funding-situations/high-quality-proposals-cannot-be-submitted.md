# High Quality Proposals Cannot Be Submitted

### Problem

There is a risk that the combination of funding categorisations prevent certain high quality proposals from being submitted.



### **Relevance to funding categorisation**

The funding categorisations used in a funding round determine what ideas can be submitted as proposals. The following categorisation approaches are relevant to the problem of ensuring high quality proposals can be submitted:

* **Inclusive vs exclusive categorisations** - Inclusive categorisations means inviting all forms of idea where as exclusive categorisations means that some focus areas would not be considered for that funding round.



### Potential Solutions



**Inclusive categorisations**

If inclusive categorisations are used it means that all forms of idea can be submitted. Inclusive categorisation helps to solve the problem of ensuring that any high quality proposal can be submitted for consideration for receiving funding.
