# Difficulty Directing Funding

### Problem

Broad categorisations could make it more difficult to direct funding to specific areas of the ecosystem and exclusive categorisations could lead to good ideas that are unable to apply for funding.



### **Relevance to funding categorisation**

Funding categorisations impact how funding is directed to initiatives as the funding categorisation which get used will determine what ideas have access to funding or not and what level of competition each proposal will have in a given categorisation based on how broad or specific the categorisations are. The following categorisation approaches could impact how easy it is for the community to direct funding:

* **Broad vs specific categorisations** - Broad categorisations will increase the competition between more proposals in a categorisation which without the right tools and processes in place can make it more difficult to direct funding.
* **Inclusive vs exclusive categorisations** - If inclusive categorisations are used then any type of idea can be submitted which without the right tools and processes in place could make it more difficult to effectively direct funding. Exclusive categorisations could help with directing funding but at the expense of optionality for the voters and increasing the probability of making bad predictions of what will happen in terms of the actual proposals submitted.
* **Unique vs overlapping categorisations** - When categorisations are unique it is easier to compare proposals of a similar focus in a single place which makes it easier for voters to determine where to direct funding with their vote. Overlapping categorisations make this more difficult as voters need to consider multiple categorisations when proposals can be submitted in multiple places to make informed decisions on how to effectively direct funding.



### Potential Solutions



**Integrate any of the many approaches that help with directing funding**

Using broad and inclusive categorisation helps to simplify the funding process drastically but can come at the expense of precision in how funding is directed unless the right tools and processes are in place. Without those tools and processes the most powerful option to decide where to direct funding - their vote! Outside of funding categorisation there is a large number of [approaches for directing funding](../../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that can be considered and integrated into the voting process to help with directing funding. These approaches help prevent the need for the community to use exclusive and specific categorisation approaches that are more complex to handle and scale.&#x20;
