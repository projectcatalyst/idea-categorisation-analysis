# Historical Comparison Of Access To Funding

### Access to funding for different proposal types

In each funding round each proposal type will have access to a certain percentage of the total funding that those proposals can request funding from.

Currently the community does funding categorisation through challenges that define a focus area and the type of proposals that should be included. The different proposals types and the percentage of the total funding amount each has access to can be determined from the aggregation of this categorisation. These values helps with:

* Making comparisons on how open or restricted each funding round is for each proposal type and then as a whole across all proposal types.
* Which proposal types have low or high access to funding.



### Comparison approach

**Proposal type percentages**

For each of the categorisations a set of proposal types were listed on a number of rows. For each of the proposal type areas they were assesses against the categorisation to determine what percentage of those proposal types could be submitted in that categorisation. As an example if you have an 'Open Source Developer Ecosystem' category that accepts event based proposals it could be roughly estimated that only a subset percentage of all the types of event could be included in that categorisation that is focussed on open source development.&#x20;



**Excluding contributor proposal types**

To make it easier to compare between historical challenges and categories the contributor proposal type categories have been excluded as those categories represent a different way to distribute funding. Categories that focus on idea focussed proposals are only included to make it a more like for like comparison. The percentages were taken from the [fund 8 budget weighting vote](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories/community-votes/fund-8-categories-budget-weighting/voting-results-fund-8) and then increased to present 100% of the weighting between the categories to make the comparison:  &#x20;

* Community & Outreach - 17% (original 14%)
* Products & Integrations - 26% (original 21%)
* Governance & Identity - 20% (original 16%)
* Development & Node Operation - 26% (original 21%)&#x20;
* Nurturing Ideas & Teams - 11% (original 9%)
* **Total**: 100% (originally 81%, now scaled up)



**Confidence colour codes**

On the data a colour of orange or green was applied to indicate the confidence that the percentage given was correct. Green represented higher confidence where as orange represents lower confidence.

Percentages representing a proposal types access to funding are rough estimations. They are based on what percentage of the potential proposal variations for that type would be able to be submitted in that categorisation.

As an example for the fund 8 challenge "Scale Up Cardano's Community Hubs" we made the estimate that around 50% of outreach & marketing proposal types could be included in this categorisation as any local marketing approaches (educational workshops, bootcamps, meetings etc) could be submitted where as there are also online communities such as outreach efforts for gaming or DeFi communities that would not fit into this categorisation.



**Location colour code**

A blue colour highlight was applied to some of the location focussed challenges. These challenges often focussed on regions or continents and were broad in focus apart from proposals needing to be about a specific location. Apart from Asia, most continents represent 25% or less in terms of population. Due to this a rounded up simple value of 25% was attached to these categorisations to signal that only a subset of proposals for any type could be submitted here as they must focus on the location stated.



### Analysis results

**Comparison analysis data**&#x20;

All the data for the analysis can be found here:

* Note: For categories a $10,000,000 budget is applied as we are only concerned about the percentages rather than any absolute values



**Category access to funding example results**

The categories were designed to be more broad and inclusive of many proposal ideas for a given type. This makes it easier to be confident around the percentages and what percentage of funding a proposal type has access to. For example if categories represented 100% of the funding allocation with the percentages used from the fund 8 budget weighting vote:

* DeFi projects - Would have access to 37% of the total funding round budget through the Products & Integrations (26%) and Nurturing Ideas & Teams (11%).&#x20;
* DAO tools & infrastructure - Would have access to 31% of the total funding round budget through the Development & Node Operation (20%) and Nurturing Ideas & Teams (11%).

**Fund 8 access to funding example results**

Attempts were made to use these similar proposal types and calculate what access to funding they would have for the fund 8 categorisations. Some were more simple due to being more specific such as 'Gamers On Chain' which had 100% access to funding for gaming projects. Others were more complex such as 'Cross chain collaboration' which could include a wide variety of proposal types under the area of interoperability and multi chain initiatives. Due to this it was difficult to do a like for like comparison for each group of proposal types between categories to fund 8 categorisation as in a number of  cases it was unclear how many types of proposal would fit into a given fund 8 challenge.&#x20;

### Lessons learnt

**Both broad and specific categorisation exist in fund 8**

In fund 8 there are good examples of fairly broad categorisation such as 'Open Source Developer Ecosystem' and also fairly specific categorisation such as 'Gamers on chain'. The impact of this is there are cases when a certain proposal type has access to multiple forms of categorisation. A simple example could be that gaming projects have access to both 'Gamers on chain' and 'DApps and integrations'. They also wouldn't be restricted from not using the location focussed categorisations if they were relevant to focussed on that location.

****

**Overlapping categorisation adds complexity and benefits from having guidance**

For the example above of gaming projects if a proposal team do decide to use DApps and integrations to submit their proposal then without assessment guidance this could be seen as against the spirit of the categorisation. To allow ever changing categorisation a set of guidelines is beneficial to reduce potential conflict over where proposers should be submitted.

****

**Difficult to easily determine what proposals should be included**

It was often not obvious what percentage to apply to some of the fund 8 categorisations when considering what potential proposal types are covered. It must be noted that the proposal types for this analysis could have been broken down further and made more specific to increase the precision of making these estimations. The confusion in trying to determine this helps to highlight the importance of considering the implications of having [defined versus changing categorisation](../categorisation-analysis/recurring-vs-changing-categorisation.md) each funding round.



**Difficult to understanding how funding is being distributed**&#x20;

As some of the categorisations were more difficult to create percentages with higher confidence it became more difficult to accurately state what access to funding each proposal type exactly had from the total funding when combined together. Due to this lack of confidence we have chosen not to create charts and diagrams based on this analysis as the visualisations may have just been misleading.



**Well defined categories make it easier to extract useful statistics**

An aim for this analysis was to be able to show how the access to funding changes from fund to fund and the issues that these constant changes can bring. The spreadsheet data helps to highlight these efforts as well as the complexity of trying to get this right for the current challenge setting approach due to the overlap and different structures that challenges use. This includes categorisations that are broad and specific, topic or location based or also that have different levels of clarity in the challenge brief. Using well defined categorisations is important to make it far easier to see exactly what amount of funding is available for each proposal type. This allows the community to track over time to determine both what funding was available to different types of proposal and also what funded was actually distributed to each type. This data would be useful for further informing better budget weighting decisions.



**Current challenge setting approach requires a lot of interpretation**&#x20;

To give an example of the interpretation that is needed one example could be that the "Cross collaboration" challenge states: "Number of events / workshops / sessions arranged with other communities" as a metric to measure. As hackathons are a form of event, proposers could interpret this as it being included in the categorisation. Another potential interpretation could be that educational resources could be included as well as they help facilitate similar outcomes as workshops. These examples are important to highlight as the complexities of having changing categorisation can increase confusion when they are less well defined. There is a complexity and time cost of having constantly changing categorisations through different challenge briefs as both proposers and assessors of proposals must spend enough time interpreting these categorisations every round to make well informed decisions or assessments.
