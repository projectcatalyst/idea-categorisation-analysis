# Rapid Funding

Many of the challenge settings from [previous selected challenges](../background/previous-selected-challenges/) and proposals benefit from having access to rapid funding. This benefit of rapid funding is also the case for when using broad categories as it accepts the same proposals that the current process does.

The following are some ideas for where rapid funding could be used for each of the broad categories. Rapid funding would be an alternative to proposal based funding. This list is not exhaustive but provides ideas towards how alternative funding could impact what teams end up using the proposal process.



**Community & Outreach**

* **Translations** - Support translators that can help improve the accessibility to events, marketing efforts, interviews, podcasts and demos.
* **Events** - Some financial support for new or existing events that provide impact to the ecosystem.
* **Community hubs** - Some financial support to help community hubs bring awareness  and education in their region



**Products & Integrations**

* **Smaller projects** - Smaller projects that require less funding to be developed could be well suited to a rapid funding approach.
* **Existing projects** - Existing established projects could request funding for certain features or improvements that would immediately benefit the ecosystem.



**Catalyst Ecosystem**&#x20;

* **Translations** - Support translators that can help improve the translations available for core resources and information used in the Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Tool, library and SDK development** - Funding support for any required maintenance or improvements for new or existing tools, libraries or SDKs used in the ecosystem.
* **Auditing** - Funding support for where more auditing efforts are needed.



**Cardano Ecosystem**

* **Translations** - Support translators that can help improve the translations available for core resources and information used in the Cardano ecosystem.
* **Tool, library and SDK development** - Funding support for any required maintenance or improvements for new or existing tools, libraries or SDKs used in the ecosystem.
* **Iteration of standards** - Funding to support new or existing standards that help improve the security, interoperability or quality assurances offered within the ecosystem
