# Purpose Of Nurturing Ideas & Team Category

**Nurturing Ideas & Team category**

The nurturing ideas & teams category puts a restriction on the funding request size of the proposals that can be submitted and then also welcomes all forms of idea and innovation that are related to Cardano.



**Potential issues with main categories**

The four main categories of products & integrations, community & outreach, governance & identity and development & infrastructure are created to cover all forms of idea and innovation.

The main problem that could emerge with just using these categories is that a larger amount of funding will be available between a smaller collection of categories. Although this brings many of the [advantages of funding categories](broken-reference) it also means there is higher competition. This competition could make it difficult for new ideas or new teams to get funding over larger and more established projects in the ecosystem.



**Categorisation as a solution**

One potential solution for this is a form of categorisation like Nurturing Ideas & Teams. The purpose of the categorisation is to limit competition between the proposals and allow more room for different ideas and teams to get exposure and funding in a more controlled environment.



**Categorisation may not be necessary**

Although this approach could be useful for helping new ideas and teams it also may not be needed. If the other categories are effectively allowing a mixture of new ideas and teams to be funded then this category can be reconsidered or even potentially removed.

Analysis will be needed to look at how funding categories are used and what outcomes occur. This insight will determine whether nurturing ideas & teams as a categorisation is effective and should be used.
