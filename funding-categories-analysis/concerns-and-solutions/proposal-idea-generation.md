# Proposal Idea Generation

## Concern

The current challenge setting process can be effective for idea generation for potential proposal teams that see a challenge and subsequently think of an idea for how to address the problem. Broad categorisation could mean preventing new ideas for proposals being formed as easily.



## Solution

**Lessons learnt from challenge settings**

Something to highlight from the challenge setting process is that the community uses its own initiative to create proposals based on the information they have to suggest areas that would benefit from further funding.

The benefit of the community writing these proposals are it can be effective at bringing awareness to the community about things happening in the ecosystem, problems that need solving or data and insights on the subject area. This information flow can help lead to creating ideas for the potential proposers looking at these challenges.

However this written content does not need to be attached to the a challenge setting that puts a mandate on where funding should be allocated to achieve the same effect.

The issue with challenge setting in this regard is that the proposal team only has their own view point of what the ecosystem needs. As the ecosystem grows increasingly over time it will mean proposal teams will struggle to understand the full needs of the ecosystem.

A ecosystem that is constantly growing will make it increasingly difficult for any challenge team to be able to define an appropriate budget for a challenge setting as there are an increasing number of variables that they should know about to make a well informed suggestion. This is also an issue for voters who would also need to be more well informed if the challenge settings mean restricting funding from one area over another.

The solution to this problem is to simply not attach the budget allocation to the challenge settings process which increasingly would become more difficult to justify as a priority over time due to the growing ecosystem complexities. As an alternative communities can create community reports to achieve the same goal of sharing quality information flow to generate ideas as detailed below.



### **Solutions options**

What can the community and wider Catalyst process integrate to most effectively help proposers think of new ideas that they can turn into proposals?



**Community reports**

Communities that form around a certain topic could add value by producing reports to help inform the rest of the community on that area. The reports could cover problems, data, insights, ideas or priorities. Data could come from the ecosystem usage or existing funded proposals. Problems and insight could come from observation, community feedback or through analysing data.

If executed to a high standard these reports could be effective for inspiring new ideas on what type of proposals the ecosystem would benefit from. These reports offer a similar approach to writing challenge settings by detailing out a problem area to address in the ecosystem. However community reports could become both more diverse with inclusions of data and insights and also more refined to a high quality that is updated repeatedly to make an effective approach to inform the community and inspire new ideas.



**Problem consensus voting**

Doing democratic votes from the community on which problems exist and which ones are the most important in the short term could be a great way to indicate what proposals would be good ideas to propose in the Catalyst funding process.
