  broad categories and whether they are effective

# Verifiability

## Concern

Broad categorisation means that more types of proposals can be submitted into each funding categorisation grouping. This makes it more difficult to apply metrics for proposals to use and track their impact.



## Solution

**Current approach**

There are issues with the existing approach to applying metrics to challenges that should be explored before considering how we can verify whether either metrics and objectives are being met. The current approach for challenge setting includes the challenge teams setting some metrics for them to be able to verify whether the challenge has a good return on intention.



**Issues with metrics in challenges**&#x20;

The major issue with putting metrics in challenges is it is very difficult to get coverage of all the types of metrics that could be useful for the proposals that are submitted. For instance, for DeFi there could be a number of metrics such as TVL, transaction volume, transaction size, number of wallets, number of actual users etc. If a challenge team was to only pick a few metrics and say these are the ones that must be tracked then that could mean being exclusionary to innovation that does not match well with focussing on those metrics. If the challenge team tries to include all forms of metrics then this adds more complexity on determining whether the challenge is verifiable. Proposals that are submitted can be very different in what they want to achieve and also could be at different stages of development. All this considered, trying to mandate a single set of metrics for all proposals is likely not either an easy or effective approach.

### **Categories and verifiability**

**Proposal focussed metrics**

Proposals that go through the funding process benefit from being able to present what metrics and KPIs are relevant to their proposal that will be to determine upon completion of the proposal whether it had a good return on intention or not. To support proposals being able to effectively articulate their KPIs and metrics a comprehensive number of examples could be created for different proposal types. These examples could help to improve the overall quality of metrics produced by proposal teams and make it easier to track whether they had an overall positive impact. Proposals are the best place to have tailored and specific metrics added that apply to that project for the community to give feedback to on whether they make sense and could lead to good outcomes.&#x20;

**Category objectives**

Objectives are well suited for categories due to the range of ideas that can be included in the funding categorisation. Categories can give a high level objective of what they want to achieve. For Governance & Identity it could have the objective to 'Support the growth and evolution of the governance and identity ecosystem in Cardano'. Then an identity proposal inside that category could have a metric for an open source identity wallet to track how many people start using it and get issued a credential. Reaching a KPI for that metric would help provide evidence that the proposal is meeting the objective of helping the ecosystem grow.



**Completion reports & community feedback**

Metrics and objectives are great to steer proposals to achieve certain outcomes however a key part of truly determining whether a funded proposal has had a positive impact in relation to the category objectives is to incorporate qualitative information from both the proposal team and the community in the forms of feedback nearer completion. Experts and topic focussed community groups are a good example of people that could review the metric results and overall objectives and provide their informed opinion on whether a good return on intention was achieved. This opinion could come in the form of a report, a numerical score or a light review. The better this feedback is the more informed the community would be on future funding decisions.
