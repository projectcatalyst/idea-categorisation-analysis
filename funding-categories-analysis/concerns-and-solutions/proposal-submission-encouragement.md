# Proposal Submission Encouragement

## Concern

By only using broad categorisation we could lose the spark of encouragement for proposers to submit proposals. When a challenge comes up for the exact thing you are interested in working on it can help create a call to action to submit a proposal.



## Solution

**Lessons learnt from challenge settings**

Challenge settings were effective at creating a call to action to potential proposers. The challenges that got set were always changing so the proposer could not be certain it would appear again. This scarcity of funding for specific areas could be seen as an effective way to encourage proposers to take action and propose solutions for these more specific areas in the ecosystem.

The problem with this attachment of challenges to budgets is there is a fixed amount of funding available in total each round. From that funding available only a certain number of challenges can get voted in which means other areas can often be excluded. This puts increasing pressure on the challenge for it to be correct that it is indeed a good focus area for funding and also pressure that proposals of a high enough standard must present themselves in this time period. Another issue is how areas excluded from the funding challenges selected may have better innovation in different areas. If these proposers are not able to access funding fast enough they may find alternatives in different ecosystems where funding may be more readily available.

Catalyst as a funding process needs to be careful in how it incentivises more proposals to be submitted and if that approach could negatively impacts other potential opportunities and options that the voters may want to choose from.

### **Solution options**

**Priority consensus voting**

Using democratic voting the community could indicate what areas of the ecosystem they believe to be the highest priority. This information for a proposal could help to generate the confidence and support that they should submit a proposal when their project matches the priorities of the community vote. The benefit of this approach is also that the priority vote outcome doesn't create a mandate on funding allocation. There would be no risk of stagnating the funding distribution when no proposal opportunities turn up in the short term.

**Bonus funding incentives**

A bonus funding incentive is the idea that the community could use funds to put up a bonus for proposals that address a certain challenge set by a community vote. Funds could come from Catalyst, rapid funding mechanisms, the community or from project teams who want a particular problem solved. For instance if a social network was the priority for the community a 10% funding bonus could be given to any proposal that gets funded through the Catalyst process that is working on a social network. This creates a bigger incentive for proposers to think about and submit proposals that address this challenge. The benefit of an approach like this is it would supplement the existing process and puts no pressure on innovation presenting itself immediately. Instead the funding would be distributed when the conditions are met for that bonus. Another benefit is the same funding could be attached to multiple bonus incentives so there is flexibility in where that small bonus get allocated. There could be a number of other alternative approaches such as based on KPIs or execution that could determine how this bonus incentive works.



**Rapid funding distribution**

Using rapid funding mechanisms could be an effective way to fund proposals that solve problems or capture opportunities when those proposals are more time sensitive. A community governance process could make the funds available to whoever can propose and implement a solution to the task.



**Quadratic funding**

[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com) can be an effective tool to more effectively distribute funding to projects or causes in a more democratic way. There is a need to solve the issues around [sybil resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack) by including one or multiple ways for the voters to verify they are a person. Quadratic funding could be used to create added incentives for people to solve certain problems or improve certain areas of the ecosystem that could help create more call to actions to submit proposals.



**Marketing**

Currently only a small amount of marketing has been explored for attracting people into the Catalyst funding process. There are a large number of approaches to trial and determine which could be effective as approaches to attract new proposers.
