# Proposal Visibility

## Concern

Using broad categorisation will make it more difficult for voters to visually go through different types of proposals such as seeing gaming, DeFi and hardware products all in one category.



## Solution

The visibility of having multiple types of proposals within categories does not need to be a funding categorisation problem. This is a view layer problem that does not need to be solved by funding categories.&#x20;

The integration of tagging and curated lists in the view layer for the voting app or proposal viewing tools can solve the problem of how the community views and compares proposals.

Proposal tagging will be an important integration into the proposal submission and voting process so that the community is able to filter proposals by a certain type such as DeFi or gaming.

Curated lists offer another organised way to create digestible groups of proposals. Curated lists could be created the community, content creators or [Catalyst contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-contributors/).&#x20;

There are a number of ways that the community can consider for making it easier to [direct funding](../../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that also help with the visibility of proposals.
