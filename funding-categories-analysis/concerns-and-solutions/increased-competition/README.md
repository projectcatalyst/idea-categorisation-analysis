# Increased Competition

## Concern

Proposers who are new to the ecosystem or that have fewer resources may find it more difficult to get exposure and funding in a competitive funding environment. Broad categorisation helps promote healthy competition however certain proposers could be at a disadvantage.

****

**Fair in theory**

Using broad categorisation allows anyone across the world to submit proposals of any type across the broad categories defined. This creates [egalitarian funding categorisation](../../../categorisation-analysis/egalitarian-funding-categorisation.md) as no preference is given to one person, proposal type or location over another.



**Can be unfair in practice**

There are a number of people that may be in more difficult living circumstances or financial situations such as in less developed countries that do not have the same resources in terms of time or capital to create effective proposals. Proposers who do have more time and resources have an advantage in being able to more easily allocate time to create proposals that have a higher chance of receiving funding.



**Decreased visibility of unknown teams or new ideas**

If existing funded proposers are well known and have been effectively delivering against previous proposals then this could have the impact of making it easier for that team to get funding in the future. This can have a negative knock on impact for new proposal teams who have to compete with more established teams. New ideas from unknown teams may struggle to get initial exposure and access to capital to prove their ideas are of importance.



## Solution

**Medium and long term solutions**

A number of approaches have been outlined in the [approaches for directing funding](../../../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) analysis that can be used to ensure awareness, support and more effective systems get put in place to help ensure proposers have a fair playing field when submitting proposals for funding. Support structures could help certain proposers ensure their proposal includes everything required, is well translated were applicable, gets suggestions for improvements and that they also get any questions answered.



**Dedicated funding category**

The potential issue with the above solutions is these solutions won't all be available in the very short term. The funding category of [nurturing ideas & teams](../../../funding-categories/nurturing-ideas-and-teams.md) has been made to help address the potential issues for newcomers or proposers with fewer resources being able to get access to funding.



### Nurturing Ideas & Teams category

Nurturing Ideas & Teams will help address some of the concerns around just using broad categories and allow all forms of ideas to be submitted.

Introduction of a category specifically focussed on supporting new ideas and teams can be a solution to the challenges that could emerge from larger categories for newcomers or proposers with fewer resources. The two main criteria for this category are as follows:



**Any proposal idea**

* The category should allow for any idea to be submitted to maximise the chance of finding new and useful approaches.
* The only requirement for proposals is it should be Cardano related as the funding is coming from the Cardano ecosystem through community votes.
* Although the other broad categorisation helps to ensure all forms of ideas and innovation can be submitted this category helps to reduce the risk of that even further. By stating any proposal idea is welcome we can further guarantee that funding is available for all forms of idea and innovation.

**Small maximum proposal budget**

* Applying a small maximum budget to proposals submitted in this category help ensure that a minimum amount of proposals will be funded. The use of a smaller cap means there will be a larger number funded.
* Increasing the number of proposals that are guaranteed to be funded will help reduce the competition between proposals as a larger number of them can be funded.
* The smaller proposal budget also is a form of a deterrent to better funded teams that are looking to request higher amounts.
* Increasing the number of funded proposals through the smaller budget also helps with increasing the number of ideas being tested in the community in parallel. This could help speed up shared learnings within the ecosystem.
* The other benefit of smaller budgets is this also means more teams will get funded. This helps to increase the diversity of people working in the ecosystem on different ideas and projects. Increasing diversity can also help to increase the rate of shared learning through different perspectives and experiences across the ecosystem.
