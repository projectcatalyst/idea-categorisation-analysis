  certain areas of the ecosystem

# Directing Funding

## Concern

Broad categorisation could make it more difficult to direct funding to specific areas of the ecosystem. We want to be able to direct funding to specific areas such as DeFi if there is a need for more innovation in that area.



## Solution

Broad categorisation is inclusive of all forms of idea and innovation which means that solutions for specific areas of the ecosystem can still be submitted.

The community still has the most powerful option to decide where to direct funding - their vote!

Another part of this problem is information flow. How does the community know exactly what problems the ecosystem needs to solve right now or areas in the ecosystem that need more attention? There are multiple [approaches for directing funding](../../categorisation-analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) for the community to consider that mean not needing to use specific funding categorisation.
