# Governance & Identity

**Category Title**

Governance & Identity

**Category question**

What tools, processes and research will improve how we integrate governance or identity solutions both in Catalyst and the wider Cardano ecosystem?

**Why is it important?**

There is a need for effective governance and identity tools and processes that make it easier to develop applications used in Catalyst and the wider ecosystem.

**How does success look like?**

Evolution of the governance and identity ecosystem tools, processes and resources to improve Catalyst and any applications building on Cardano.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Tracking success for this category will mean:

* Increasing the number or quality of tools, libraries & SDKs that can help improve areas around governance, identity and DAOs.
* Solutions and processes for the Catalyst ecosystem that improve the overall process, tools being used, decision making, ability to deliver rapid funding or auditing of proposals.
* An increased amount of support in the forms of research, educational resources, hosted discussions, mentors or accelerators that help support and improve areas around Catalyst, identity or governance.&#x20;



Individual success metrics are added for the different types of proposal in the category brief. These metrics provide suggestions for how different proposal types could be audited.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Governance & Identity is focused on the following areas:

* Tools, libraries and SDKs that help with improving governance and identity around the systems used in Catalyst or for applications in the wider ecosystem.&#x20;
* Resources, processes, documentation, mentors and accelerators that make it easier to participate and engage in the Catalyst governance process.
* Research, analysis and reports that help drive novel or improved approaches for governance or identity that can be used in Catalyst or the wider ecosystem.

**Why this category is important**

Catalyst provides the governance process for the distribution of funding from the Cardano treasury.&#x20;

To maximise the potential of the ecosystem there is a need for effective and robust governance and identity tools that help with determining how to distribute treasury funding. Achieving this will create a thriving community, an easier to use development ecosystem and nurture a growing list of products and integrations.

This category also concerns any identity or governance solutions used in the wider ecosystem that will help to ecosystem to thrive.

The better that Catalyst and applications in the wider community are able to effectively govern and apply identity to their applications and processes the more the ecosystem can thrive on reliable and trustable infrastructure. More open source tools for governance and identity within the ecosystem will help with increasing the rate of people developing novel solutions to different problems.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Tools that help with governance participation and decision making that can be used by Catalyst but also could be used by other teams building in the ecosystem. Tools for governance will help the Catalyst function more effectively as a DAO.
* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps the wider community to build DAOs for their own projects.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Identity tools that help with Catalyst governance or that could be used in other applications across the wider ecosystem. Identity solutions could be Atala PRISM focussed but could also be integrations of other identity systems into the Cardano ecosystem.
* **Rapid funding mechanisms** - New rapid funding mechanisms looking at improving the distribution of funding of the Cardano treasury.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Tools and process improvements that help with auditing funded proposals to help ensure they have the support needed to maximise the impact produced.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Tools, guides, mentors and programs that help people with going through the Catalyst funding process and working on their project.&#x20;
* **Resources, processes, hosted discussions & documentation** - Proposals aimed at helping improve understanding and engagement with the Catalyst ecosystem or around governance topics such as improving decision making or processes for how the community reaches consensus.
* **Governance research and analysis** - Research and analysis projects that will help improve how the community can approach governance. This can include exploring existing or new governance models that could improve how the community approaches distributed governance.
* **Education** - Demos, guides, videos or documentation for improving the education resources available about the different governance and identity tools, libraries and processes available in the ecosystem.

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

This list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Rapid funding mechanisms** - Number of participants involved in governance process, speed of funding distribution, number of projects supported through mechanism.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Amount of adoption from other projects, number of projects being audited, number of projects receiving extra support, number of projects having funding halted due to lack of execution.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Number of projects onboarded onto support programs, number of projects supported.
* **Resources, processes, hosted discussions & documentation** - Number of viewers on content, reduction in common questions support due to better resources or documentation.
* **Governance research and analysis** - Number of citations, number of projects utilising research or analysis in their execution.
* **Education -** Number of viewers or participants of education resource, testimonies on the quality of the resources made from community feedback.



**Considerations for proposers**

* **Open source plan** - Any tools, libraries or SDKs are encouraged to be open source either from the start or as soon as possible. There is no requirement to be open source immediately however proposers should include the details of their plan towards open sourcing the project.
* **Commercial projects** - Development projects most suited here will be open source with the aim of the work executed being available for the benefit of other projects to use and build their applications with. Commercial projects looking to build a network or DApp suited for an end user should use the Products & Integrations category for proposals. Projects are welcomed to make proposals in this category for any specific parts of their project that would be open source and should have benefit to the wider ecosystem for helping with governance or identity.
