### Funding access for different focus areas

### **Funding categories equivalent**

After reviewing the [data covered in the methodology](methodology-data-and-feedback.md) for fund 7 a similar funding categorisation outcome could have been achieved with funding categories as an alternative categorisation approach by applying the following budget weightings:

* **Community & Outreach** - 15%
* **Products & Integrations** - 30%
* **Governance & Identity** - 30%
* **Development & Infrastructure** - 25%



### Observations

**Restrictive funding access**

Fund 7 had far much more limiting access to funding for a number of proposal focus areas. The funding categories equivalent achieves more access for all of the proposal focus areas to a fairly significant degree. This could have helped with both competition and better variation of the proposals submitted to give the voter more options to choose from.



**Few broad categorisations**

The only main broad categorisations were [Open Source Developer Ecosystem](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnCM) and [DApps & Integrations](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBoNV) however there total budget was still low. This contributed towards the lack of much funding being available for many of the areas that could be covered in the ecosystem.



**Large usage of specific categorisations**

There were a number of specific categorisations that meant limiting the types of proposals that could be submitted such as [Boosting Cardano's DeFi](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnJW), [Lobbying for favorable legislation](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnJd), [Connecting Japan/日本 Community](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnVu), [Gamers On-Chained](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnPQ), [Seeding Cardano's Grassroots DeFi](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnWs), [A.I. & SingularityNet a $5T market](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnKN), [Nation Building Dapps](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBmrP), [Multilingual resources](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBneK), [Improve and Grow Auditability](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBneL) and [Catalyst Accelerator & Mentors](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26255/about).&#x20;



**Categorisation interpretation is needed**

Some categorisations such as [Miscellaneous Challenge](http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnH5) invite proposals based off them not being able to be submitted elsewhere. This adds large complexity as the proposer and voter need to be aware of which proposals should be in what categorisations amongst all the options to fulfil that requirement.
