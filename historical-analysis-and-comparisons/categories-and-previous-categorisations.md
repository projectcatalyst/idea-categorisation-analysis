  categories?

# Categories & Previous Categorisations

Every existing previous funding categorisation created through challenge setting fits into the funding categories approach. There are a number of challenges that would have proposals that fit into multiple categories. One example is the 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' challenge where proposals for that challenge could be applicable to nearly all of the categories defined below.

**Nurturing Ideas & Teams**

This category is open to any idea from the community so all previous challenges could have proposals that fit into this category. The only constraint in the [Nurturing Ideas & Teams](broken-reference) category is proposals have a small maximum budget so they can try out different ideas and form teams.
