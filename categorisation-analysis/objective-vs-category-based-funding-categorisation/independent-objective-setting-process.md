# Independent Objective Setting Process

The objective setting process does not need to be tied to the funding categorisation process within Catalyst. There are a number of benefits of having an objective setting process for the Cardano ecosystem that operates independently from the Catalyst process. In this arrangement the Catalyst process would instead pull in the objectives and information from this independent process and that information can then help guide the categories and budget weightings that are used and proposals can link to the objectives they are looking to address.



If [category based funding categorisation](./) is used in Catalyst an independent objective setting process would be eventually needed proposals can specify which objectives they are addressing.  Having access to these objectives can offer an effective way to improve decision making for category budget weightings decisions based on the most voted on objectives.



### Independent objective setting process

**Advantages**

* **Flexibility and speed** - An independent objective setting process doesn’t need to be in sync with round based funding and instead can be completely dynamic in accepting updates, information and new objectives. This means having flexibility to showcase changes immediately and to allow objectives to be updated with new information and be reprioritised as needed. Objectives can also be easily imported into other funding approaches such as rapid funding which adds flexibility on where these objectives get used in the ecosystem. Keeping objectives separate from proposal funding also means more easily being able to support the other types of incentives that can exist like credentials and non financial based rewards that can encourage people to support achieving objectives.
* **Interactivity** - An independent system for objective setting can incorporate more tools and processes to encourage better discussion, feedback and debate on defining the objectives and their prioritisation. With funding categorisation there is a need to agree on a final categorisation for proposals to use in a funding round. An independent process for objective setting better encourages constant interactivity and feedback from the community that can lead to better objectives that could become higher priority.
* **Quality and coverage** - Creating quality objectives that are well informed is a difficult task and one that requires constant feedback and reflection to determine whether an objective is still relevant or may have recently been achieved. By having an independent process for objective setting that is not tied to funding categorisation a stronger focus can be placed on why this objective is being added, how it can be measured and how effective have efforts been so far in meeting that objective. The better these tasks can be achieved the higher the confidence can be given that the community is solving high priority objectives. By removing funding categorisation out of the objective setting process the efforts around defining which proposals can be submitted and what budget is available can be dealt with separately. Mixing objective setting and funding categorisation creates a more time consuming task to execute well as it comes with all the issues of promoting competitive, changing and specific funding categorisations.
* **Scaleable & inclusive** - An independent objective setting process can allow for a wider range of objectives to be present and included in the process as there would be no constraints like with funding categorisation that must delegate a fixed amount of funding between a sensible amount of different categorisations. This makes an independent objective setting process more inclusive to smaller communities and voices that want to showcase their own objectives. Although lower priority objectives may not influence the ranking of proposals in the Catalyst process they could at least be integrated into the proposal information so that the community is at least aware the a proposal is looking to support a lower priority objective. By allowing a wider range of objectives to exist it offers a better chance for smaller voices to be heard and for impactful objectives to have the chance to float to the top from a range of different sources.
* **Effective integration into Catalyst** - An independent objective setting process can be effectively integrated into the Catalyst process. First of all the objectives are a source of data that can be useful to influence decisions around the budget weightings used on the funding categories. As an example if there was lots of objectives around the governance of different open source protocols then this could influence the community in deciding to increase the budget weighting for a category such as ‘Governance & Identity’. For the voters the benefit of an independent objective setting process is that a more diverse range of objectives could be attached to proposals which are looking to address a mixture of objectives or one that are lower priority. Higher priority objectives that the wider community votes for can also good candidates for being part of the ranking process for showing the most promising proposals to voters. This will help the community easily find the proposals that are addressing the most pressing objectives as voted on by the community. Separating objectives from the funding categorisation means the community gets all the benefits of prioritising important objectives but then can also get the benefits of category based funding categorisation that promotes the usage of recurring, inclusive and broad categorisation.



**Issues**

* **Unexpected outcomes** - Having a more dynamic objective setting process independent from the process used for Catalyst funding comes with the benefit of flexibility and speed however this could also lead to unexpected outcomes. For instance in some cases the objectives could change in a short time frame but close to the voting period and lead to sudden changes in which proposals are ranked higher than others. This would influence who ultimately gets funded. The implications of this is the community would need to have a high confidence that the objective setting process is legitimate and not easily gamed due to the short term influence the system could have on which proposals are funded.
* **Lack of implementations** - Currently there is no community created solutions that help with democratic objective setting that are interactive and allow for constant feedback and discussion. This is a short term issue that can be addressed by the community.



### Example usage situations

**Proposal submitted solving an important problem**

A team submits a new proposal that looks to address upcoming issues around quantum computing and its implications for blockchain technology. They highlight the reasons why this is an importance objective for the community due to the negative implications on the security of parts of the Cardano blockchain. With objective setting that is separate from the funding categorisation process this objective can be presented immediately into the process and start gathering feedback from the community. If the community votes on the objective as being higher priority after a short time period then the rank of this objective may rise higher in the list of current objectives. If these objectives are incorporated into the ranking of the proposals then this could work its way into the voting stage of the Catalyst funding process and have a positive influence on which proposals are funded that address this objective. This example helps to show how new emerging objectives could be introduced easily and then impact the voting process in a small time period without a need to change the funding categorisation.



**Recently launched solution solving existing objective**

A new open source solution gets launched. The solution solves an existing objective of bringing smart contract access to hardware devices. The impact of this solution and achieving the objective could result in the removal or reduced prioritisation of that existing objective. Allowing these objectives to change dynamically in their prioritisation will help the community to become more aware of what proposals in the Catalyst funding process are the highest priority at exact moments in time.



**New information emerges regarding an objective**

A natural disaster could occur and results in more data and insights into problems around water and food access. If the community has objectives that exist around improving these areas in society then their importance based off recent events could influence the priority of those objectives. Having a system that constantly accepts new information would be an effective way to allow the community to dynamically prioritise areas of increased importance. This is especially useful when potential solutions might be available that could solve those issues if they were funded.



### Summary

* There are a large number of benefits to having an independent objective setting process that makes it more flexible and faster to incorporate insights, feedback and a changing environment into creating high quality objectives.
* The impact of a system and process focussed on objective setting could be highly useful. A lot of due diligence would be needed on the execution of that process to prevent malicious actors from negatively influencing its usage.
