# Recurring vs Changing Categorisation

### Funding categorisation: recurring vs changing

Funding categorisation could be well defined and repeatedly used in each funding round or alternatively could be always changing with new categorisation approaches used each round.



**Recurring categorisation**

Recurring categorisation means looking to make sensible groupings of similar proposal types that are well defined. These categorisations can be used on a recurring basis in every funding round. Recurring categorisation would still be changed over time, but the aim would be only to change the categorisation when it was more clearly necessary.

**Changing categorisation**

Changing categorisation looks to introduce a new grouping for proposal types each funding round. This is not to say similar categorisation couldn't be used again but instead that categorisation can easily be redefined and updated as part of the process each funding round.&#x20;



### Factors to consider

* **Budget weighting complexity** - What complexity is there for deciding the budget weightings for each categorisation approach? How much effort and how long will it take to get a well informed outcome?
* **Categorisation justification** - How complex is it to provide evidence and data to justify all categorisation selected for a given funding round? How much effort and governance is required?
* **Directing funding** - How effective is the categorisation for directing funding to certain areas that need more funding support?
* **Governance effort** - How much effort is needed to govern the specificity of the categorisation?
* **Stakeholder effort** - How much effort is required to maintain this type of categorisation from the stakeholders involved in the funding process?



### Recurring funding categorisation

**Advantages**

* **Less budget weighting complexity** - Using similar categorisations in each funding round will mean having more data and insights in how the categorisation was used in previous rounds. This data will make it easier for people to make well informed decisions on how to better distribute funding between the categories in the following rounds.
* **Low categorisation justification** - All effort for categorisation is done upfront and then changed when necessary. This means stakeholders involved in managing the categorisation don't need to justify it each funding round and this effort is done only justified once.
* **Low governance effort** - Repeatedly using the same categorisation means you don't need the community to review and vote on which categorisation to use and instead focus on the budget weightings of the ones that are defined.
* **Low stakeholder effort** - By having recurring categorisation used each funding round the proposers and voters get the benefit of having categories they become more familiar with over time and can fully understand the types of proposals that should be placed in each categorisation. This simplicity reduces ongoing mental effort for all stakeholders involved to understand the categorisation part of the funding process which helps to speed up their interactions with the funding process.&#x20;

**Issues**

* **Harder to direct funding** - Using similar categorisation means that it will be less effective at restricting funding to one area over another at the categorisation level. This is not a large issue as the voters still get to decide where they want to allocate funding using their vote and there are many [approaches for directing funding](approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that can be used.



### Changing funding categorisation

**Advantages**

* **Easier to direct funding** - Changing categorisation each funding round means the community could make groupings that focus on a different areas that are of higher importance in the short term to allocate funding for specifically. This however can come at a cost of putting a mandate on where funding must be allocated and increases the risks where solutions may not turn up for this new funding categorisation.

**Issues**

* **Increased categorisation justification** - If categorisation changes every funding round the community will need to review and justify that the categorisation is suitable to be used in the funding process.
* **Increased budget weighting complexity** - New categorisation approaches would need to find relevant insights, data and community feedback to justify the budget weighting of the categorisation. If it is a new type of categorisation it may be difficult to determine what a sensible budget weighting would be.
* **High governance effort** - Every funding round those involved in governing the categorisation would need to review all the categories being suggested and ensure the right information is covered to make well informed governance decisions.
* **High stakeholder effort** - Voters and proposers would need to get familiar with new categorisations every funding round. This increases the time required to fully understand what categorisations exist and the types of proposal that should be included.



### Summary

* **Many ways to direct funding** - Having changing funding categorisation can be one way that the community could use to direct funding. The problem with this is it means predicting ahead of time what amount of solutions for that categorisation of proposal types will present itself and also provides no guarantee that quality proposals will be submitted. There are other incentive models and ways to improve information flow and governance that can be used to [direct funding](approaches-for-directing-funding.md).&#x20;
* **Changing categorisation introduces high effort and complexity** - Constantly changing categorisation has a cost for all the stakeholders involved in the funding process in terms of time required and governance effort. There are numerous ways to [direct funding outside of changing the categorisation](approaches-for-directing-funding.md). With no other significant benefits for changing categorisation on a regular basis there does not appear to be many reasons to justify adding the complexity of changing the funding categories used so regularly.
