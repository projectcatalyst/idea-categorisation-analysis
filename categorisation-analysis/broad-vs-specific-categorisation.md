# Broad vs Specific Categorisation

### Funding categorisation: broad vs specific

Categorisation can be either broad and have a large amount of ideas and innovation in one category or be more specific and have more specific ideas and innovation included in each category.

**No categories -** Funding goes through a single grouped process. Proposals compete with every other proposal.



**Broad categories -** Funding is allocated between a small number of broad categories with a larger budget weighting applied to each of them. Examples categories include Products & Integrations, Governance & Identity and Development & Infrastructure.



**Specific categories -** Funding is allocated between a number of specific categories that would mean using smaller budget weightings applied to each of them. Example categories include AI & machine learning, transportation or DeFi.



**Very specific categories** - Funding is allocated between a large number of very specific categories with much smaller budget weightings applied to each of them. Example categories could be Japan local events, DeFi in Botswana or IoT for agriculture farming.



### **Factors to consider for categorisation**

* **Budget weighting complexity** - What complexity is there for deciding the budget weightings for each of the categories in a funding round? How much effort and how long will it take to get a well informed outcome?
* **Proposal visibility** - How easy is it for proposals to be seen? Is there high competition causing lower visibility?
* **Directing funding** - How effective is the categorisation for directing funding to certain areas?
* **Governance effort** - How much effort is needed to govern the specificity of the categorisation?
* **Stakeholder effort** - How much effort is required to maintain this type of categorisation from the stakeholders involved in the funding process?
* **Level of competition** - High competition can be good for selecting the best proposed ideas and innovation from a wider proposal pool but comes at the cost of making it more challenging for smaller teams. Lower competition for categorisation has the benefit of helping spread the competition difficulty that will help smaller teams but comes at the cost of an increased chance of funding innovation that is not as effective due to the lower competition.



### No categories

**Advantages**

* **No budget weighting complexity** - All funding is available in one process meaning no categorisation complexity is present in each funding round.
* **No governance effort** - This categorisation is the most simple to govern as no decisions would be needed around justification of weightings, no data or insights need to be collected to justify one decision over another.
* **No stakeholder effort** - Proposers, community advisors and voters would not spend anytime dealing with the maintenance of the categorisation as all proposals would go into a single place.

**Issues**

* **Very low proposal visibility** - With just one category it becomes hard for individual proposals to stand out against all other proposal teams. This results in a high need for better tagging and community curated lists for small proposals to get better visibility.
* **No precision for directing funding** - No effort is made to steer funding into a certain area for the wider ecosystem. This could result in more popular areas repeatedly receiving more funding than is needed. However voters in this scenario still fully determine where funding is allocated which is a democratic solution.
* **Very high competition** - The good part of high competition is that it can help for the best projects to rise to the top and receive funding. However using no categorisation to this level also means that smaller teams would need to compete with every single larger team in the ecosystem against every form of idea and innovation meaning the competition would be at its highest. This categorisation would increase the difficulty for smaller or less known teams to secure funding.



### **Broad categories**

**Advantages**

* **Low budget weighting complexity** - Usage of only a few categories results in a low complexity for determining what amount of funding should be allocated to each one.
* **Low governance effort** - Governance efforts only need to focus on the budget weighting between a small number of categories meaning less precision is needed than having a higher amount of specific categories.
* **Low stakeholder effort** - Proposers would not need to submit proposals concerning challenge setting, community advisors would not need to assess the extra challenge setting proposals and voters wouldn't need to spend time ready and comparing multiple more specific challenges.
* **Good competition** - The smaller the amount of categories there are the more competition there is for proposers. This is good for healthy competition and also helps to keep some of the different areas more separated so a more popular area doesn't overwhelm other proposals. A category can also be considered to help with competition that is targeted at new ideas and teams such as [nurturing ideas & teams](broken-reference).&#x20;



**Issues**

* **Lower precision for directing funding** - Directing the funding to more precise areas within the category can still be difficult as more types of proposals are competing under the same category. However ultimately the most effective way to direct funding is through voting as the voters would still determine how funding should be directed by deciding which proposals to vote on.
* **Lower proposal visibility** - Having only a few broad categories makes it hard for some proposals to stand out against larger more established teams. There could be a need for some form of tagging and community curated lists to help aid in visibility for smaller teams.



### **Specific categories**

**Advantages**

* **Good proposal visibility** - Proposals would generally have surrounding proposals in a more specific category making it easier to get clear proposal visibility for proposals in that specific area.
* **Higher precision for directing funding** - Using more specific categories makes it easier to allocate funding to more precise areas in the ecosystem.

**Issues**

* **High budget weighting complexity** - Every extra specific category makes it more complex to determine the budget weighting that should be allocated to each area in the ecosystem.
* **High governance effort** - A sufficient governance process is needed to inform stakeholders voting on budget weighting on the implications of increasing or decreasing the funding provided to certain areas in the ecosystem.
* **High stakeholder effort** - Stakeholders would need to generate information flow of reasons for and against increasing or decreasing funding in certain areas. This may include data, insights or analysis. Those stakeholders involved in voting for the decision would also need to read this information to make informed decisions.&#x20;
* **Lower competition** - Increasing the amount of categories means there is less competition between each of the proposals in a given category. This increases the chance that there can be categories that have a weaker pool of ideas and innovation meaning it could lead to worse outcomes.



### Resolving issues for broader categories

**Improving proposal visibility**

Two easy ways to help improve the proposal visibility would be using effective [tagging for proposals and curated lists](approaches-for-directing-funding.md). Better tagging of proposals would mean it would be easier to group proposals based on common topics such as finance, agriculture or legal focused proposals. Curated lists are another way where community members could create and share lists of proposals about a given topic to highlight proposals that the community would benefit from reading about before voting. Curated lists could also mix well with the potential use of experts from different market segments.

**Improve ability to direct funding**

One way that funding could be directed better to more precise areas in the ecosystem is by creating a governance system for the community to vote on which areas they believe require the most attention. This could also include qualitative information. The results could then be made available to the wider community during funding rounds so people are aware of the thoughts of different people in the community to take that information into account when voting on proposals. There are a wide number of [approaches for directing funding](approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that the community can consider and integrate into the process.

### **Resolving issues for specific categories**

**Reducing budget weighting complexity**

It is difficult to decide how much funding should be directed to specific categories. To resolve this issue there would need to be a thorough process to gather a sufficient amount of data and justification to support decisions on which area requires more funding over other areas. The more specificity added to the categorisation the more complex and thorough a governance process **** is needed to effectively decide on final budget weighting allocations.



### Summary

* **Specificity adds significant budget weighting complexity** - The more categories that get added to the funding round process the more complex it becomes to determine a sensible budget to allocate to each category.
* **Easier to solve proposal visibility and directing funding issues** - Better tagging, curated lists and gathering community feedback can be effective ways to organise and distribute information to the community that help solve issues for broader categorisation around proposal visibility and how funding is directed to more precise areas.
* **Broader categorisation takes far less effort and governance** - Less information, governance and tools are needed for more broad categorisation as fewer categories mean there's less effort needed to determine a suitable budget for each of those categories.
